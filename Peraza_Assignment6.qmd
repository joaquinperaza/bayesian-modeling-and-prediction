Data model:

$$
\begin{equation*}
[y_{ij}|z_i, a_j]
 = 
\begin{cases}
0 ~ \text{if} ~ z_i=0, \\
Bern(a_j) ~ \text{if} ~ z_i=1,
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$$ Process model:

$$[Zi|p] = Bern(p)$$

Priors:

$$[p]=Beta(\alpha_p, \beta_p) ~~ \alpha_p=1, \beta_p=100$$

$$[a1]=Beta(\alpha_{a1}, \beta_{a1}) ~~ \alpha_p=80, \beta_p=20$$

$$[a2]=Beta(\alpha_{a2}, \beta_{a2}) ~~ \alpha_p=22, \beta_p=200$$

par(mfrow = c(1, 3), mar = c(5, 5, 8, 1))
plot(seq(0,1,0.01), dbeta(seq(0,1,0.01),1,100), type = "l", col = "blue", xlab = "p", ylab = "[p]")
